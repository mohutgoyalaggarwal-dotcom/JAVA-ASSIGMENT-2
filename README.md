Method Overloading Calculator
This is a simple Java-based Calculator Application that demonstrates the concept of method overloading.
The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with support for different data types (integers and doubles) and varying numbers of parameters.

Features
Addition (Method Overloading):
Supports multiple ways to add numbers:

Add two integers
Add two doubles
Add three integers
Subtraction:
Subtracts two integers and displays the result.

Multiplication:
Multiplies two double values.

Division:
Divides two integers with proper handling for division by zero.

Menu-Driven Interface:
Provides an interactive menu for users to choose operations and input numbers dynamically.

Error Handling:
Includes exception handling for invalid operations like division by zero.
